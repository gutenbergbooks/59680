</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Modelled by the sea,
which is the reservoir
of all the forces, you
enchant us and you
sway us by that grace
and by that calm which strength alone
possesses, and you bestow on us your
serenity. It prevails like the charm
of melodies powerful and deep.</p>

<p class='c007'>What triumphant amplitude! What
vigorous shadows!</p>

<p class='c007'>From the boundaries of the two
worlds’ throngs come to contemplate
you, venerated marble; and the twilight
deepens in the room that you
may be more clearly seen, shining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>alone, while the silent hours pass,
heavy with admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still you hear our clamours, immortal
Venus! Having loved your
contemporaries, you belong to us,
now, to all of us, to the universe.
The twenty-five centuries of your life
seem only to have consecrated your
invincible youth. And the generations,
those waves of the ocean of
the ages, to you, victorious over time,
come and come again, attracted and
recalled irresistibly. Admiration is
not spent as a marble wears away.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the poets, to the seekers, to the
quiet artists, in the heart of the city’s
tumult, you give long moments of
refuge. Mutilated, you remain entire
to their eyes. If the ravages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>time have been permitted, it is only
that a trace may continue of their
profane effort and of their impotence.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are not a vain and sterile
statue, the image of some unreal goddess
of the Empyrean. Ready for
action, you breathe, you are a woman:
and that is your glory. You are
goddess only in name; the mythological
nectar does not run in your
veins. What is divine in you is the
infinite love of your sculptor for nature.
More ardent and above all
more patient than other men, he was
able to lift a corner of the veil too
heavy for their idle hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>And you are not, moreover, a mosaic
of admirable shapes. There are
no admirable shapes, but the shapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>that agree, those that summon and
presuppose one another according to
the irrefutable logic of harmonious
necessity, those that borrow life from
one another. Yours gather in an indivisible
whole, and it is the calm
torrent of life that passes over you,
that torrent whence you have sprung,
naked and one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Collected beauties could never have
attained this unity. One detail that
harmonized not with all the others,
the least variance between the profiles,
and the work of art would be
destroyed, a useless thing, a senseless
construction, renounced by the light,
and doomed to all the poverties, to
all the discords. This would be fatally
the lot of even a clever assemblage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of even perfect pieces, chosen
from different marbles.</p>

<p class='c007'>But you, you live, you think, and
your thoughts are those of a woman,
and not of I know not what superior
being, foreign, imaginary, artificial.
You are made only of truth;
and it is of truth alone that your
omnipotence is born. There is nothing
strong, there is nothing beautiful
outside of the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your truth is within reach of everyone:
it is woman, whom each one
thinks he knows, the intimate companion
of men; yet nobody has seen
her, the wise not more than the simple.
And the trees, who looks at
them? The light has no spectators.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, except through confining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>oneself to the observation of
reality, constant, scrupulous, and ever
more profound, no one can accomplish
anything. There are people
who say to you, “The Ideal.” If
this word is not void of meaning,
it signifies only a stupidity. The
Ideal! The Fantasy! But the realities
of nature surpass our most ambitious
fancies. Our thought is but
an imperceptible point in nature.
The part does not embrace, does not
dominate the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man is incapable of creating, of
inventing. He can only approach nature,
submissively, lovingly. For the
rest, she will not disappear from his
sight; he has but to look, she will
let him see what by force of patience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>he has arrived at understanding—that
only. And yet the part is beautiful!
He is an equal of Prometheus, he,
who has known how to ravish from
nature the life we adore in the Venus
of Melos.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing will take the place of
persevering study. To it alone the
secret of life delivers itself. Give
your life patiently, passionately to
understanding life. What profit, if
you come indeed to understand! You
will be in the circle of joy forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>To understand, to see—truly to
see! Would one recoil before the
necessary effort, before the indispensable
apprenticeship, however long
and laborious, if he foresaw the happiness
of understanding?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>To understand! It is—not to
die!</p>

<p class='c007'>For me the antique masterpieces
are mingled in my memory with all
the pleasures of my youth; or rather
the Antique is my youth itself that
rises again to my heart and hides
from me my age. In the Louvre,
of old, like saints to a monk in his
cloister, the Olympian gods said to
me all that a young man might usefully
hear; later they protected and
inspired me; after an absence of
twenty years, I found them again
with an indescribable joy, and I understood
them. These divine fragments,
these marbles, older than two
thousand years, speak to me louder,
move me more than human beings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In its turn may the new century meditate
upon these marvels, and may it
try to ascend to them through intelligence
and love. It will owe to them
its highest joys. Man may be the
forger of his happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Antique and Nature are bound
by the same mystery. The Antique—it
is the human workman arrived
at a supreme degree of mastery. But
Nature is above him. The mystery of
Nature is even more insoluble than
that of genius. The glory of the
Antique is in having understood
Nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>O, Venus of Melos, the prodigious
sculptor that fashioned you knew
how to make the thrill of that generous
nature flow in you, the thrill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of life itself—O, Venus, arch of the
triumph of life, bridge of truth, circle
of grace!</p>

<p class='c007'>What splendour in your beautiful
torso seated firmly on your solid legs,
and in those half tones that sleep
upon your breasts, upon your splendid
belly, large like the sea! It is
the rhythmic beauty of the sea without
end.... You are in truth the
mother of gods and of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The generative profile of that torso
helps us to understand, reveals to us
the proportions of the world. And
the miracle is in this, that the assembled
profiles, in the sense of depth,
of length, and of width, express, by
an incomprehensible magic, the human
soul and its passions, and the
character that shapes the heart of
beings.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_012fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The ancients have obtained by a
minimum of gesture, by their modelling,
both the individual character
and the grace borrowed from grandeur
that relates the human form to
the forms of the universal life. The
modelling of the human being has
with them all the beauty of the
curved lines of flowers. And the
profiles are secure, ample like those
of great mountains; it is architecture.
Above all they are simple; they are
calm like the serpents of Apollo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it is the terms of anatomy
that have had the deplorable effect
of imposing on the mind the prejudice
toward the division of the shapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of the body. The great geometric
and magnetic line of life hence remains
as if broken in the regard of
the passer-by. This theoretical analysis
has altered among the uninitiated
the sense of the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of art protests against
this false and factitious idea of division.
Those concordant shapes that
pass one into the other as undulate
the knots of the reptile, and that suddenly
penetrate, they are the body in
its magnificent unity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Left to themselves the ignorant see
only the apparent details of things;
the source of expression, the synthesis
alone eloquent, escapes them. It is
lamentable that anatomic description
gives in some measure support to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>plastic ignorance of the multitude, in
calling attention, through its terms,
to the different parts of which the
architecture of the body is composed.
Those pedantic words, biceps, triceps,
brachial or crural, and so many
others, those current words, arms,
legs, plastically have no significance.
In the synthesis of the work of art,
the arms, the legs, count only when
they meet in accordance with the
planes that associate them in a same
effect, and it is thus in nature, who
cares not for our analytical descriptions.
The great artists proceed as
nature composes and not as anatomy
decrees. They never sculpture any
muscle, any nerve, any bone for itself;
it is the whole at which they aim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and which they express; it is by large
planes that their work vibrates in
the light or enters into the shadow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus from the point whence I am
looking at the Venus of Melos, all
of the three-quarter profile is streaming
with light, while the opposite
side bathes in the shadow. Toward
the base of this profile one just distinguishes
half-tones. Higher up,
farther away, the head rises and
reigns, modelled by light and shade,
while the reposing lines, the sloping
lines of the back play together their
slow melodies. What condescendence
the long gentle lines of that back express,
and the flight of the loins into
the half-tone! Sublime pride of marble!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Tranquil life of the soul of the
body! Nature is an uninterrupted
harmony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider the Venus from any profile
you choose. That we were just
admiring is of a beauty that invokes,
that imposes the idea of the eternal.
But change your position; here is another
profile: it is equally marked
with the seal of the imperishable.
All of them incite admiration and
tenderness. They are happy, at ease
in the calm air.</p>

<p class='c007'>That face has the variety and the
liberty of a flower, and the artist,
leaning attentively over it, rises as
one vowed to religion: he has heard
Venus speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will walk round her.... Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>is another profile that shows me the
face. There is shadow in that mouth;
a moment ago there was none; to
drawing is added modelling, and the
lines that hesitated have become decided.
The edge of the lips is slightly
rimmed, the edge of the nostrils also;
these are the signs of youth. The
mouth has in it the drawing of the
school, but it is on the plane of a
master. The error would be to seek
the measurement of the lips. It is
all in the plane of the head, of the
cheek. That cheek, which appears
to me lost in profile, that cheek is
all of sculpture, as one virtue is every
virtue.—O mouth so simple, so natural,
so generous! It holds thousands
of kisses! Impossible to escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>its charm. Even the most ignorant
visitor is touched by it. How clearly
one sees that the woman has posed
for the divinity!</p>

<p class='c007'>The soul of shapes breathes in the
profound life of this thrilling body.
I see her magnificent armature of
bones as I see her thoughts—all her
grace hidden and present, how powerfully
organized! In this form sweet
as honey, where the eye surprises
neither blacks nor violent lights, but
where life flows without jerks or
starts, clear as live water, one feels
keenly the resistance of a resolute and
powerful frame! Supported by these
bases that will not weaken, sure of
their solidity, the flesh bounds with
joy as if it would escape the redoubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>shadows deepening under the
breasts, that they may rise from the
torso, whence glowing light would
seem to emanate.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the high adorable face gives
to every one gracious welcome of
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shadows, the divine play of
shadows on antique marbles! One
might say that shadows love masterpieces.
They hang upon them,
they make for them adornment. I
find only among the Gothics and
with Rembrandt such orchestras of
shadows. They surround beauty with
mystery; they pour peace over us,
and allow us to hear without trouble
that eloquence of the flesh that ripens
and amplifies the spirit. That eloquence
darts on us the truth, diffuse
as light. It is the radiancy of gladness.
What secret emotion invades
me before the meditated grace of this
design! Ineffable passages of light
into shadow! Inexpressible splendours
of half tones! Nests of love! What
marvels that have not yet a name in
this sacred body! Venus Genetrix!
Venus Victorum! O, total glory of
grace and of genius!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_020fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Admiration overtakes me like sleep.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Venus of Melos is reflected by
all the others: in them is accentuated
one or another of her infinite beauties.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this one, free of all draperies,
the modelling of the shadows makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the flesh breathe even more voluptuously;
that thigh, column of life, is
literally quivering.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this other, the light and shade
of the belly and of the legs produce
a kind of fluctuation where passes
all of love; all its intoxication and
then its appeasement. The upper
part of the body inclines in a gesture
of reverence; movement how gracious!
Where the Gothic and the
Renaissance find their symbol.</p>

<p class='c007'>And again this one, what instinct
bends it into an arc of grace! A
single curve made of all those, of
the shoulders, of the legs, of the
thighs, designs the kneeling Venus.</p>

<p class='c006'>I possess a little masterpiece, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>long baffled all the habits of my
eyes and of my mind, all my understanding.
I have vowed to it deep
gratitude, for it has made me think
a great deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>This figure belongs to the epoch of
the Venus of Melos. It gives me the
same sensation of modelling, powerful
and abundant; it has the same
ease in the grandeur of its forms,
although they are materially of reduced
proportions. What calm intoxication
it breathes and inspires, or,
rather, what luxury of pleasure!</p>

<p class='c007'>The beautiful shadows that caress
it have all the same direction, turn
all in the same sense. With what
science, with what wisdom they cause
the breasts to jut, and then, slumbering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>on the wide belly, vigorously
model the thighs!</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the arms at the side is
drawn back and drowned in delicate
light and shade. The gesture of the
other arm holds the draperies over
the thighs to gather below the belly
fervent shadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shadow, desired by the artist,
makes for all this figure a first tunic,
veiling certain shapes and discovering
others of them. Looking closely,
one sees that all these varied tones
are underscored by a single dark line,
the line of strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the principle of beautiful
sculpture as of beautiful architecture.
The expression of life, in order to
keep the infinite suppleness of reality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>must never be stopped or fixed.
The dark element, essential to the
effect, must then be carefully contrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>One observes that the antique masterpieces
have all been treated in this
way. That is why they produce the
impression of sweet measure and of
durability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Badly proportioned the results are
truly blasphemies against nature.
They no longer have eloquence, and
breed only harshness and meagreness.
From a distance, moreover,
measure yields the most powerful results.
The Venus of Melos in particular
owes to this moderation her
power of effect. There is nothing
abrupt. Approaching her step by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>step, one imagines that she has been
gradually modelled by the continuous
effort of the sea.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
